//! Phase 4: Rebirth — Committor Function (Rare Event Prediction)
//!
//! Adapted from the orkid FMD physics engine (`fmd-physics/src/tps.rs`).
//!
//! The committor function q(x) is borrowed directly from Transition Path
//! Sampling (TPS) in statistical mechanics — it quantifies the probability
//! of reaching a target state from the current state.
//!
//! In the Phoenix cycle, this is the rebirth phase: after the burn and
//! extraction, what is the probability that the resulting artifact is valid,
//! uncontested, and achieves its purpose?
//!
//! ## The Formula
//!
//! `q(x) = hits / total_trajectories`
//!
//! For ensemble-based TPS:
//! - `predicted_time = avg_steps × dt`
//! - `confidence = 1 / (1 + std_dev / avg_steps)`
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use negentropy::Committor;
//!
//! // 7 out of 10 trajectories reached the target state
//! let comm = Committor::from_ensemble(7, 10);
//! assert!((comm.probability - 0.7).abs() < 0.001);
//! assert!(comm.confidence > 0.0);
//! ```
